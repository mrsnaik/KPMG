This is Small Responsive web Application for Tax Calculator
Skills used

C#, ASP.net , MVC , Entity Framework , bootstrap and wcf
I tried to put best practices whenever and wherever possible

Things achieved:-

you can choose .csv file and upload from KPMG\KPMG.TaxCalculator\KPMG.TaxCalculator\CSV files
There are some examples .csv file resided

It validates details and imports to database

I have used Model first approach using EntityFrameWork, So It will automatically create Database from Model defined
Intially there won;t be any data in database so No data will be on Transactions Details Screen

You don't have to run any database script as it will create database as soon as you run your application because of
Model first approach

You can upload transaction data from csv file just clicking on CSVFile1 from Top menu , it has set to choose 
specific file resided and put validations on it and save it database

From menubar Home is current screen where you can see CSV uploder and some messages

Transaction Details from top Menu will show you list of transactions from database where you can edit and delete
them and also you can directly put new transaction to Database by clicking on Create New

there are some validation on screen from where you add new transaction same as on edit Screen

This is my best effort to showcase my skills in specified time limit
